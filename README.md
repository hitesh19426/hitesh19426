- 👋 Hi, I’m @hitesh19426

- 👀 I’m interested in cp, web dev, app dev or most things computer science related. 
I like applied maths a lot, solving questions and applying techniques. I like gaming but my laptop does not support it xD. 
Maybe I will continue gaming when I have my own gaming laptop.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning cp, html, css, javascript, flutter (if my laptop will run it). 
I will like to learn more on web dev and app dev.
