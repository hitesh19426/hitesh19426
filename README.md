- 👋 Hi, I’m @hitesh19426

- 👀 I’m interested in cp, web dev, app dev or most things computer science related. 
I like applied maths a lot, solving questions and applying techniques. I like gaming but my laptop does not support it xD. 
Maybe I will continue gaming when I have my own gaming laptop.

- 🌱 I’ve worked with C++, Java, Python for coding.
- React-JS, React-Routes, Hooks, Functional Components for web development
- React-Native and Flutter for app development.
I will like to learn more on web dev and app dev.

- 💞️ I’m looking to try out open source development/contributions once.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
